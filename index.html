					Quest<br><br>

                    <div class="description">Meena has noticed something troubling—valuable scrap that’s been collected for the Scrapper’s Society has been mysteriously disappearing overnight. The scraps are essential for the Society’s creations, and Meena suspects that several groups of thieves are behind the thefts. She needs you to retrieve 15 pieces of stolen scrap that have been taken in the dead of night. These stolen materials are being hoarded by a variety of dangerous figures lurking throughout the region.</div>

					ELITE Quest<br><br>
					Level 34+ Suggested, 25 Required.<br><br>
                    <div class="description">Listen closely, friend. We’ve uncovered the mind behind the recent scrap thefts—Olarek, a cunning worgen who’s been orchestrating these raids on behalf of the Nightbane. He may not be their leader, but he’s the brains behind their operation, coordinating every stolen piece of scrap that should be ours. He prowls around a worgen camp just south of Darkshire, surrounded by his loyal pack. Olarek is no easy target. He’s a powerful foe and makes sure to keep himself well-guarded. If you can take him down, it’ll cripple their thieving operations and send a clear message. Bring me proof of his defeat, and I’ll see to it that the Society rewards you for your bravery.</div>
