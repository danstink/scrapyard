            <h2>The Necrotic Legion</h2>
			The Necrotic Legion has silently infiltrated Azeroth, a formidable coalition of necromancers, demons, and dark masterminds. Operating from the shadows, they have begun to seize vast and powerful territories, spreading fear and death with every step. Their ranks are filled with the spirits of the fallen, bound to their will and used as tools of terror and control. With the power to manipulate life and death itself, these dark forces seek to dominate all of Azeroth, unraveling the very fabric of existence. Their plans are as insidious as they are deadly, and if left unchecked, they will bring the world to its knees. It is imperative that they are stopped before their unholy reign spreads beyond salvation.

			This content is designed for level 48-60 <br><br>
			Orgrimmar has been taken over by powerful necromancers and their demonic minions. The city’s residents have been killed and their souls bound to the will of the Necrotic Legion. The takeover went unnoticed due to other major events happening at the time, particularly the operations of the Scrappers Society and the threat of Naxxramas, which drew attention away from the growing danger in Orgrimmar. The city now lies in ruin, controlled by dark forces. Quests are available starting at level 40, but it is strongly advised to wait until around level 50 before entering, as the area is extremely dangerous. Orgrimmar is just the first major outpost to fall under the Necrotic Legion’s control, with more territories likely to follow.

			<h3>Scrapper's Society Tier III</h3>
			Scrapper's Society Tier Three is where goblin craft meets clever negotiation. Though they’ve already secured premium scrap from all corners of Azeroth, the goblins have set up a unique system to ensure adventurers truly earn the right to access it—and perhaps, serve the goblins’ own “interests” along the way. To unlock this high-grade scrap, adventurers must obtain commendations from prominent figures throughout Stranglethorn by completing tasks and favors. These commendations, while proof of loyalty, also serve as a valuable currency for the goblins, allowing them to gain special privileges around Booty Bay. With enough commendations, adventurers can bargain for scrap, which they can then trade for powerful, specialized items crafted by the Scrapper’s Society.
